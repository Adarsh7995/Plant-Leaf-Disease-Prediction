                        Chilli leaf curl virus is transmitted by whiteflies and is a serious threat to chilli fields.<br/>
                        1.There is need to control the whitefly population to prevent the virus from spreading.For this you can use neem or horticultural
                        oils.Ensure that the oils are thoroughly applied to the plants,especially to the lower side of the leaves where whiteflies are most likely to be found.
                    <br/>
                        2.Plants that are very early infected and have a very low disease incidence should be removed and burned as soon as possible.<br/>
                        3.A sticky yellow trap or yellow sheets should be placed at different locations throughout the field to attract the whiteflies.<br/>
                        4.You can control whiteflies by spraying five tablespoons of dishwashing soap in 20 liters of water at intervals of 7-14 days to keep them away.<br/>
                        5.It is recommended that you spray neem seed water extract to control vectors within 14 days of their appearance.
